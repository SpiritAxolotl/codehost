# Changelog

## 2023-11-21

- Switched to Toxic theme

## 2023-09-21

- Remove font size rule from code blocks
  - It looks really weird to force the code block font size to be bigger than
    the rest of Cohost
  - Yeah it's kinda small by default, but I'd rather it didn't make the code
    stick out too much

## 2023-08-13

- Removed bold font from code; increased text size
- Made the "Syntax highlighting by codehost" footer a little more hidden by
  right-aligning it and nudging it closer to the code block
- Added information about requesting new languages
- Added support for dark mode to the page
